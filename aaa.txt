take file from sublime and open with other text editor.

diff between plain text file and binary file.?

why a same file is appearing different in different text editors.?

if 1-- images put on html page,101 requests are generated. for external css, it is loaded.....
hyperlink - for one hyperlink- 1 request only when we click on it, the request comes.

browser cache- it keeps a copy of source it gets from interne, it has a time when it gets that source. So when we relaod it , it may not go back to inetrnet to get it. So immediately after the reload it may loaded the page.


<br>
<span>

<href> ... most powerful html tag- all www is linked with links. navigability, connectivity.

using angular or higher frameworks, we can make user defined tags.
